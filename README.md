# Web Development - Final Project

## About the course: 
During Coderhouse`s 10 week web development course, i was able to learn to create a website starting from a prototype. I learned the best practices of web development, working with HTML and CSS. Also, i learned how to optimize my website to the maximum, implementing code versioning practices with GIT, and preprocessors such as SASS.

## About the project:

## Technologies used: 
- HTML
